## Scaling Configuration on Render

### Web Services

Backend:
- Initial: 1 instance
- Auto-scaling:
  - Min instances: 1
  - Max instances: 4
  - Scale up: CPU > 70% for 5 minutes
  - Scale down: CPU < 50% for 10 minutes
- Memory: 512MB per instance
- CPU: 1x shared CPU

Frontend:
- Initial: 2 instances
- Auto-scaling:
  - Min instances: 2
  - Max instances: 6
- Memory: 256MB per instance
- CPU: 0.5x shared CPU

Worker:
- Initial: 1 instance
- Auto-scaling:
  - Min instances: 1
  - Max instances: 3
- Memory: 512MB per instance
- CPU: 1x shared CPU

### Database

PostgreSQL:
- Plan: Starter
- Storage: 10GB
- Connections: Up to 40
- Extensions: pgvector enabled

Redis:
- Plan: Starter
- Memory: 256MB
- Maxmemory policy: allkeys-lru

## Monitoring & Alerts

1. Metrics Collected:
- Request rate
- Error rate
- Response time
- CPU usage
- Memory usage
- Database connections
- Queue length
- Vector search latency

2. Alert Thresholds:
- Error rate > 1% for 5 minutes
- Response time > 1s for 5 minutes
- CPU usage > 85% for 10 minutes
- Memory usage > 90%
- Queue delay > 5 minutes

## Cost Optimization

1. Instance Types:
- Use shared CPU instances for cost efficiency
- Auto-scale based on demand
- Scheduled scaling for known peak times

2. Database:
- Start with smallest instance
- Enable connection pooling
- Monitor query performance

3. Caching Strategy:
- Redis cache for frequent queries
- Browser caching for static assets
- CDN for global users

4. Vector Search:
- Batch vector calculations
- Cache common searches
- Implement semantic caching

## Manual Scaling Steps

1. Via Render Dashboard:
```
Services -> [Service Name] -> Settings -> Instance Type
```

2. Update instance count:
```
Services -> [Service Name] -> Settings -> Number of Instances
```

3. Modify auto-scaling rules:
```
Services -> [Service Name] -> Settings -> Auto-scaling Rules
```
